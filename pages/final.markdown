<h2>Instructions</h2>
For your Final Project, I want you to explore the various approaches to Data Science you’ve learned this quarter. Specifically, you are required to outline how you would integrate a variety of Data Scientific methods and theories in a project addressing a novel question that can be answered using data. Imagine you knew all the ins-and-outs of Data Science, data mining, analysis, programming, and statistics, and write your final outlining your question, hypothesis, overall approach, analysis, and conclusion.

Your question could be purely scientific (e.g., “How do different cultures perceive different colors?”), just interesting (e.g., “What are commonly misheard song lyrics?”), or statistical (e.g., “How big do crowds need to be for reliable estimates of different kinds of questions?”).

Your Final Project will have the following sections: Question, Hypothesis, Background Information, Data, Ethical Considerations, Analysis Proposal, Discussion, Group Participation

Remember to proofread your essays and that you are not using overly flowery and/or vague language. Use as few words as possible, but no less, to describe your approach. Concision is key, you wouldn’t over engineer a system. Correct? Why would you over engineer your prose? Think Hemmingway, not Faulkner. A small portion of your grade will be dependent on your ability to write clearly, and logically, and without errors that should be caught during a proofreading. As well as your ability to follow all the instructions laid out in this document.

You will turn in one PDF as a group into Gradecope by the due date. There are no late submissions accepted, unless there is an issue outside of your control. If so, email your course instructors and all your teammates. Before the due date.

**Assignment #1**

The first assignment was meant to get you and your group started on your final project. This assignment will require you to complete the first half of your final project. In this report, you included information in the following sections of what will become your final project:
- Question
- Hypothesis
- Background Information
- Data
- Ethical Considerations

**Final Project**

You can access the Final Project template (link above).  Make a copy of this document and give edit rights to all members of the group. The first five sections of this document are the same as your first assignment. You should copy and paste your first assignment into this document, replacing the pertinent sections. Be sure to incorporate feedback from the instructional staff you received on A1 and update anywhere with information you learned in the second half of the course to improve these sections. It is OK if these sections remain largely the same as what you submitted for A1 if you believe they are solid and good to go. But now that we have learned quite a bit since A1 was due. And we will be looking for cleaner text and clear logic. E.g. you may need to tighten up your data science question in order to do an analysis.

Note: You are allowed to completely change your original project, if as a group you decide you want to go in another direction. You do not have to get approval to do so. 

After editing the first five sections of your project, you will replace “ADD YOUR GROUP’S TEXT HERE AND DELETE INSTRUCTIONS ABOVE” with your group’s response for the remaining sections and delete the grey instructions for the following sections:
- Analysis Proposal
- Discussion
- Group Participation

For these additional sections, read the instructions provided on your assignment for each section. Replace the instructions within each section with your group’s project information. When complete, **save the document as a PDF and submit on Gradescope**. Be sure to add all group members to the submission on Gradescope. Note! You (individually, not the group) can’t receive a passing score on this final if you don’t contribute. **Please make sure everyone on your team has responsibility. If you do not contribute anything…**

*You shall not pass...*
