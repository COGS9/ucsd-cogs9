<h2>Instructions</h2>
Wait until section to sign up for a group. Your TA will randomly assign you into a group. Once you are in a group you will open this google sheet, and fill out your name and email. As groups will still be somewhat in flux during the first 2 weeks (late adds/drops) this sheet will help you keep track of your group's emails and member names.

Click the link above to open the Google Doc for assignment 1. You can not edit this document, you must create a duplicate of it into your own Google Drive. Your group will work out of this document. When ready to submit, save the document as a PDF, and turn it in as one submission (per group) in Gradescope.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions - FAQ</h2>

 1. How specific does our data science question need to be?
 > Not very specific at this point. Coming up with a good data science question is very tough. It is typical to begin a project with a more relaxed, general question. As you perform analysis, seek more data, and talk with domain experts/stakeholders your questions tends to get more specific. The final project is a good place to take your Assignment 1 question and refine it to be more specific. For now just think about what type of data and topics interest your group, and formulate a question from that limited information.
 2. Do we need to find actual data that fits our question?
 > Good question! No you do not. in-fact I would be surprised if any team actually finds a good data set with everything they need to perform such an analysis. What we are looking for is that you sought out a data set with data that is close enough to your topic/question. If there are not enough observations, or missing fields/variables, that is ok! You can still use the data, just let us know what or how much is missing. E.g. A data question could be studying the association between height and GPA, but perhaps your dataset does not include GPA, but avg. test score per class. This is ok, just let us know what data you wish you had and what that data would like.
 3. How much background info do we need?
 > We all can't be domain experts, nor may you always be able to find one. Think about logical/critical thinking. Do your hypothesis and data science questions flow together? How do you justify your hypothesis and position, what limited background info have you read about? Talk a bit about these decisions in your assignment 1.
