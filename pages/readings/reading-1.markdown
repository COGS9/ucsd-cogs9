# Reading 1

Reading 1 is mainly concerned with defining data science, and thinking about how it fits into the spectrum of academic disciplines. Does data science actually exist? How does it fit in with statistics and computer science? If it is an actually academic field, how does one perform and study data science? This is the longest reading, so please take your time and start early!

  - This is a guide I wrote a number years ago on how to approach reading and digesting academic articles. An ever increasingly useful skill, especially for undergrads working in computer science and data science.

  - Here is a reading guide that covers the major concepts, as well as some of the more difficult parts of the paper. This guide would be good to go through after reading the paper and to have by your side for the quiz.
