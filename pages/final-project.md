# Final Group Project

For your Final Project, I want you to explore the various approaches to Data Science you will be learning this quarter. Specifically, you are required to outline how you would integrate a variety of Data Scientific methods and theories in a project addressing a novel question that can be answered using data. Using all you know about Data Science, data mining, analysis, programming, and statistics (based on what has been covered in the course and your own reading), I want you to write your final project outlining your question, hypothesis, overall approach, analysis, and conclusion.

Your question could be purely scientific (e.g., "How do different cultures perceive different colors?"), just interesting (e.g., "What are commonly misheard song lyrics?"), or statistical (e.g., "How big do crowds need to be for reliable estimates of different kinds of questions?").

Your Final Project will have the following sections: Question, Hypothesis, Background Information, Data, Ethical Considerations, Analysis Proposal, Discussion, Group Participation

Remember to proofread your essays and that you are not using overly flowery and/or vague language. Use as few words as possible, but no less, to describe your approach. Concision is key, you wouldnâ€™t over engineer a system. Why would you over engineer your prose? Think Hemmingway, not Faulkner. A small portion of your grade will be dependent on your ability to write clearly, logically, and without errors that should be caught during proofreading.

You will turn in one PDF as a group into Gradescope by the due date for part 1 and part 2. Any late submission will have 5 points deducted immediately, and a further 5 points deducted after 24 hours. Submissions later than 48 hours will get 0.

After the 27th of January this spreadsheet will be locked, and any further changes must go through Dr Burrows. We strongly urge you to form your team by the 27th.
