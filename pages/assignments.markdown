<h1>Course Assignments</h1>

Assignment 1 and the Final group project are linked together closely. We will go over assignment 1 in class and in discussion session thoroughly. Assignment 2, 3, and 4 are separate and provided to enhance what is taught in lecture. These assignments are not difficult, but we do look for critical thinking, and attention to detail. Make sure you read and follow the instructions closely. You will get to play with interactive web widgets and data science/machine learning widgets and answer questions based on the interactions.
