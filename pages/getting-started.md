# Getting Started

1. Join the class Discord: Link TBD
   - Use Discord to ask questions and get help from your fellow students, TAs, IAs, and myself
   - In-class polls (instead of iclickers) are done through Discord, as well as for questions that we do not have time to answer in class.
2. Register for class Gradescope
   -  link-{{ variables.gradescope_link }}
   -  **entry code:** {{ variables.gradescope_entry_code }}
   -  When registering for **Gradescope** you must include your **Student ID/PID** and **UCSD Email**.
3. Start Reading 1, it is the longest by far
4. Make sure you attend discussion section during week 2, we will be forming groups for the final project
