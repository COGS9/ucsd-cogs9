<h1>Final Exam</h1>

The final exam is an opportunity to test how all of you are learning the lecture material. The best way to study for the exam is to carefully review your lecture notes and readings, think about the main topics in the lectures/readings, and then determine the details that support each of those topics. For example, we talk about reproducibility and replicability. These are both major topics from one of the lectures. It is very likely that a question on the exam will be about this topic.  

{: .important }
The exam is an open note exam, to be taken at the comfort of your own home. Once you begin the exam, you must finish it in one sitting. I strongly discourage students from using ChatGPT/other AI chat resources during the exam - these resources are brilliant for helping you through assignments or final projects as they can help you to think critically about the problems at hand. However, this exam is to test your learned knowledge of these topics - your ability to recall such topics from memory is an excellent indicator of how well you TRULY know the subject matter and can apply it in the future. Given that I can't stop students from using AI resources like ChatGPT to answer for them, I am making the exam time quite short (TBC but I think 60 questions in 60 minutes). This is intended to discourage students from use of ChatGPT and to learn the material from memory. 

To help students, since this is an intro class and we cover a **wide** range of topics, I make available a study guide to help you wrangle in all those key high level topics. It is up to you to flesh it out more, and fill in the details.
