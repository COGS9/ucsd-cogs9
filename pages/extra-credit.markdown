<h1>Extra Credit Info</h1>

There are four extra credit opportunities in class. Assignment 1 (2 points), a mid-quarter team eval (3 points), a final quarter team online eval (2 points) and finally UCSD CAPE reviews (5 points).

<h2>Assignment 1 group sign-up sheet</h2>
During your discussion section, your TA will assign you to a group. If you correctly fill out the group sign-up sheet, and ensure all your group members have your name and email, then you will get 2 points. Easy.

This eval will close on Sunday week 10, before finals week.

<h2> CAPE reviews</h2>

CAPE reviews are a great opportunity to share with instructional staff what you thought about the course. I am always striving to improve and tweak the class so I read all my CAPE reviews and take them seriously. It gives you, the student body, a voice. I consider them important and thus if at least 70% of the class fills out CAPEs by the due date, I will award the whole class 5 points of extra credit.
