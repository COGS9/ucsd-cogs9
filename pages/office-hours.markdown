NOTE: Office hours start week 1, Not week 0.


Office hours are a great place to personally interact. Beyond projects and course material, we are interested in your goals, career endeavors, and what you want to gain from Cogs 9. Data Science is a rapidly changing field and there is always a lot to discuss.

If you are unable to join or are having other issues, please reach out after class (I tend to do impromptu office hours after each class if I have time) or in section. Additionally, we are more than happy, to set up additional 1:1 or 1:group meetings when necessary.
