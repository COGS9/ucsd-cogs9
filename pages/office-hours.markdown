Office hours are a great place to personally interact. Beyond projects and course material, we are interested in your goals, career endeavors, and what you want to gain from Cogs 9. Data Science is a rapidly changing field and there is always a lot to discuss. 

I split my office hours into three 20 min blocks.

- Block 1 & 2: reserved for students or groups to sign up
- Block 3: Open for anyone on a first come basis.

NOTE: If you want to talk about assignment 1 or your final assignment, please sign up for one of the 20 minute time blocks. This helps us dedicate a set time to your group's specific questions.

If you are unable to join or are having other issues, please reach out after class (I tend to do impromptu office hours after each class if I have time) or in section. Additionally, we are more than happy, to set up additional 1:1 or 1:group meetings when necessary.
