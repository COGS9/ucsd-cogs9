#### Office Hours
Interactivity with course staff in our still semi-remote class is challenging. To offset this challenge office hours will be spread throughout the week and occur both in person and over Zoom.

Office hour attendance is not required, but if you are unable to join or are having other issues, please reach out after class or through email. We are more than happy, to set up additional 1:1 or 1:group meetings. Finally, office hours are a great place to personally interact. We are interested in your goals, career endeavors, and what you want to gain from Cogs 9. Data Science is a rapidly changing field and there is always a lot to discuss.
