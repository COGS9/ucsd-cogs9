# Office Hours
Office hours are a great place to personally interact. Beyond projects and course material, we are interested in your goals, career endeavors, and what you want to gain from Cogs 9. Data Science is a rapidly changing field and there is always a lot to discuss.

I split my office hours into three 20 min blocks.

- Block 1 & 2: reserved for students or groups to sign up (use this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jtsbQL55JvpUGZjcG13DoCZRYn6nAzpSX5dWE48yVAc/edit?usp=sharing))
- Block 3: Open for anyone on a first come basis. But please if there are many people after you, limit yourself to one or two questions. I am also happy going over time if needed.

If you are unable to join or are having other issues, please reach out after class (I tend to do impromptu office hours after each class if I have time) or in section. Additionally, we are more than happy, to set up additional 1:1 or 1:group meetings when necessary.
