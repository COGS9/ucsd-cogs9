# Office Hours
Interactivity with course staff is one of the best ways to solidify your learning, as well as ask specific questions about the course, your projects, and questions about the field of data science. I typically split my office hours into three 20 min blocks. The first 2 blocks are reserved for students or groups to sign up (use the link below) and ask detailed questions about their projects. The final 20+ min block is open for anyone to join and ask questions or talk about anything. This is on a first come basis, but please be respectful of your fellow students and if there are many people after you, limit yourself to one or two questions. If there are many people I do not mind going over the third 20 min block.

Please use this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jtsbQL55JvpUGZjcG13DoCZRYn6nAzpSX5dWE48yVAc/edit?usp=sharing) to sign you or your group up for office hours.

Office hour attendance is not required, but if you are unable to join or are having other issues, please reach out after class or in section. Additionally, we are more than happy, to set up additional 1:1 or 1:group meetings. Finally, office hours are a great place to personally interact. We are interested in your goals, career endeavors, and what you want to gain from Cogs 9. Data Science is a rapidly changing field and there is always a lot to discuss.
