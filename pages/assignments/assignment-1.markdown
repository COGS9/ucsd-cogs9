<h2>Frequently Asked Questions - FAQ</h2>

 1. How specific does our data science question need to be?
 > Not very specific at this point. Coming up with a good data science question is very tough. It is tyical to begin a project with a more relaxed, general question. As you perform analysis, seek more data, and talk with domain experts/stakeholders your questions tends to get more specific. The final project is a good place to take your Assignmnt 1 question and refine it to be more specific. For now just think about what type of data and topics interest your group, and formulate a question from that limited information.
 2. Do we need to find actual data that fits our question?
 > Good question! No you do not. in-fact I would be suprised if any team actually finds a good data set with everything thye need to perform such an anlysis. What we are looking for is that you sought out a data set with data that is close enough to your topic/question. If there are not enough observations, or missing fields/variables, that is ok! You can still use the data, just let us know what or how much is missing. E.g. A data question could be studying the association between height and GPA, but perhaps your dataset does not include GPA, but avg. test score per class. This is ok, just let us know what data you wish you had and what that data would like.
 3. How much background info do we need?
 > We all can't be domain experts, not may you always be able to find one. Think about logical/critical thinking. Does your hypothesis and data science questions flow together? How do you justify your hypothesis and position, what limited backgroun info have you read about? Talk a bit about these decisions in your assignment 1.
