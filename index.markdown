## Welcome to Cogs 9!

Welcome to Cogs 9 - Intro to Data Science 
We are all very excited that you decided to join us on this whirlwind tour of data sci. All the information you need and due dates are located on Canvas (specifically the Home page), and in the syllabus and course calendar (both linked from the homepage). All announcements made in class will also be posted here in Canvas. Furthermore, if you need to learn remotely or miss class, the lecture (recorded from last summer) will be posted on Canvas the same day or earlier.
Office hours will be a mix of zoom and in person, we will also have extra office hours and no discussion sections to facilitate people learning remotely. This is a group work based course and you will all be randomly assigned a group on the first day of class. Please contact each other as soon as possible and establish a routine. You should be able to see your group's email address on the group page within Canvas. If you have any issues please reach out to the course staff and we will help you. Some students have found this link

We look forward to teaching and working with all of you and hope to meet you in office hours.
Cheers,
Cogs 9 Staff
